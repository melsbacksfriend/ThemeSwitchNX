# ThemeSwitchNX
A theme randomizer HB app for the Switch

The icon is what it is because this was tested with a PokÃ©mon theme and an Ubuntu theme.  

# Usage: 

1. Install a theme with nxthemes installer.  

2. Copy the .szs files from sdmc:/atmosphere/contents/0100000000001000/romfs/lyt, sdmc:/atmosphere/contents/0100000000001007/romfs/lyt and sdmc:/atmosphere/contents/0100000000001013/romfs/lyt folder to sdmc:/themes/shuffle/1 DON'T PUT THE .SZS FILES IN ANY FOLDERS WITHIN THERE!  If any folders are nonexistent or empty, skip them.

Repeat the process increasing the number that is the name of the folder in sdmc:/themes/shuffle by one every time.  

Create a file named themecount.txt on the root of your sd card where the contents are just the number of themes you have.  

# Reason I made this:

SysThemeSwitcher was archived before the titles -> contents rename.  This is a replacement.
